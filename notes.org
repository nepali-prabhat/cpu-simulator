* CPU Simulation
  Some time back I designed a basic computer in a software called Logisim.
  I want to recreate that software in the web and build a basic computer there.

** Why the web?
   1. The web is easily accessable by everyone. Thus, there will be less friction to showcase my work.
   2. We can easily port a web application to native app using electron, tauri, etc, if needed.
   3. I am already working on the web. 

** Project goals
   
*** TODO Stories
    - [ ] 
    - [ ] Toolbar that contains gates
    - [ ] Make AND, OR and NOT gates
    - [ ] Select a gate and place it in the canvas
    - [ ] 
 
** Development process
   Since I am the solo programmer in this project, I have to be resourceful.
   I'll use the following technologies

*** Technologies 
    - Tailwindcss
    - Radix ui
    - jotai
